	Created by Grace Li (ICS3U1-02) (Mr. Saleem)
	Date: June 1st, 2018.



Brief: The player is a farmer whose farm is being overtaken by robotic
	rabbits, a.k.a. RABBOTS. The goal is to defeat the RABBOTS by
	using cannons to shoot carrots at them.


Controls: Use the mouse to navigate all buttons in the game. When in
	tutorial mode, use the right arrow key to move to the next
	slide. When in game mode, click on a cannon to purchase, and
	click again to place it. Press space to pause the game.


Game Modes:

	1) Timed Mode
		- in this mode, the rabbots will appear at custom-set
		times, and the type to appear has also been predetermined.
		- There is a progress bar which moves when a rabbot has
		been defeated.
		- When all rabbits have been defeated, the game will
		end, and the user will be asked if they wish to try
		infinity mode.
	
	2) Infinity Mode
		- in this mode, there are an infinite amount of rabbots
		that will appear. The lane they appear in is random,
		but the type of rabbot is controlled by how many rabbots
		the player has defeated so far.
		- The frequency of rabbots appearing increases as the
		game progresses.
		- For added difficulty in this mode, each defeated
		rabbot gives less money than in timed mode.


Tips:
	- In timed mode, start from the iron cannons (third from left of
	the shop selection). Build one in each row, and then build one
	gold cannon in each row.

	- In infinity mode, plant a metal cannon (second from left of the
	shop selection) in each row first, then gold, then platinum.
